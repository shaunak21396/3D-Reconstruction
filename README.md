# 3D-Reconstruction
Estimation of the Fundamental Matrix and Triangulation applied of stereo image pairs

<h2>What I learned:</h2>

- <b>Application of the following Python libraries/packages:
  1. Numpy
  2. Matplotlib
  3. SciPy
  4. OpenCV
  5. Imageio

- <b>Practical implementation of Epipolar Geometry and Triangulation.
- <b>Formulation and implementation of Fundamental camera matrix using the Eight-point algorithm.
- <b>Neccessity of Normalization of list of 2D points so that problem is well conditioned.
- <d>RANSAC algorithm and it's importance in dealing with noise and outliers.
